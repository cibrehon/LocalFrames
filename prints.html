                            All photographs on this website are available as professional prints worldwide. The photographs are printed on a ILFORD GALERIE Washi Torinoko paper. Torinoko paper is a fine art paper with a traditional, Washi, Japanese base and a fine textured surface.  
                        </br> 
                        </br> 
                        The base, exclusively produced for ILFORD, is manufactured using a traditional Japanese Tanmo machine which produces a paper so refined it looks like it has been handmade. The Washi base is made in the Echizen area of Japan, which is famous for the production of traditional Japanese paper with a history spanning over 1500 years in paper production. 
                            

                        </br> </br> All prints are signed by the photographer on recto and stamped on an acid free paper on verso.
