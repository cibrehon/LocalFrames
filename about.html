                            Ege Ilicak (b. 1988) is a self taught Turkish documentary and street photographer, currently based in Heidelberg, Germany.

                     </br></br>
                     Born and raised in Ankara, Turkey, Ilicak has always been fascinated by life on the streets. The complicated and fascinating motion that drives life also drives his passion for documenting it, and sparks his inspiration.

                     Since 2012, Ilicak documents people's daily lives with his camera and intends for others to experience a candid visual experience.
