                            Ege Ilicak is a Turkish documentary and street photographer, currently based in Heidelberg, Germany.
                     </br></br>
                            Born in Ankara, Turkey in 1988 into a neighbourhood that offered daily lessons in a divine commedy of human behaviour, Ege has always been fascinated by the life on the streets and the complicated and fascinating motion it involves, and this was the spark that inspired his passion to photography.
                     </br> </br> Since 2012, Ege captures people's daily lives with his camera and intends for others to experience a candid visual experience with cinematographic image characteristics when they see his work.
